# Japanese Text Tools

A lightweight, no-nonsense web toolbox for editing and converting Japanese text and numbers.

I built this in early 2025 after constantly struggling with Japanese forms and clunky online tools. Most existing solutions are either hard to find, riddled with ads, behind paywalls, or just don’t cover all the edge cases I ran into.

## Features

- Convert Romaji ↔ Katakana ↔ Hiragana
- Spell out Latin letters in Katakana
- Convert full-width ↔ half-width characters
- Simulate max-length Japanese text fields (e.g. names in forms)
- Convert Japanese ↔ Arabic numerals
- Browse commonly used non-textual characters (e.g. 〒 ★ ♪)

## How to Use

Just visit [japanesetexttools.com](https://japanesetexttools.com) and use the tools right in your browser.

- ✅ No login
- ✅ No ads
- ✅ No server-side processing — all data stays on your device
